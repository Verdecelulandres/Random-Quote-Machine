<------------------------------SOURCES-------------------------------------->

I took guide from  youtube video sources to create this project:
    1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDWwhVoCvHM
    2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_W1jXY-2-0

I just used #1 to get started because I did not know how to set-up react and node in my computer. 
I used #2 to understand how to get the quotes database, fetch it with an async function to use in my react app.

The template code was provided by running the npx create-react-app command

<------------------------------SOURCES-------------------------------------->

I took guide from  youtube video sources to create this project:
    1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDWwhVoCvHM
    2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_W1jXY-2-0

    I just used #1 to get started because I did not know how to set-up react and node in my computer. 
    I used #2 to understand how to get the quotes database, fetch it with an async function to use in my react app.
    

APIs Used:    
    1. https://cssgradient.io/
    2. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json'

    Used #1 to get the default background for the page
    Used #2 to get the quotes and authors

The template code was provided by running the npx create-react-app command

The main functionality was made with React. Main styling was done with Sass and buttons and layout was partially done with Bootstrap.

My project changes the colors of the background using the linear and radial gradient CSS functions, just because I thought it looked prettier.
